## I am currently working on:
### üóª Minecraft plugins for server BLACKMC.PL
Last few months i worked on multiple plugins for new guild mode. We are currently in testing phase, before release.

Some of the features:
- guild upgrades
- guild guardians - custom mobs that guild members can give basic commands and are protecting players base
- universal box system - allows to add multiple different boxes that will drop from activities like breaking blocks, killing certain type of mobs or fishing. Each box is fully customizable via configuration file.
- set of items with unique behaviour

I've also create few plugins that are currently working on server:
- yrden, vampirism rune (which are adding new combat skills)
- lobby PVP mode
- GUI for ProtectionStones plugin
