### 🗻 Minecraft plugins for server BLACKMC.PL (Java, Bukkit)
I developed multiple plugins for a guild mode based on funny guilds plugin.

**Guild mode features:**
- Guild upgrades
- Guild guardians — custom mobs with basic commands to protect player bases
- Universal reward box system — customizable boxes triggered by activities (block breaking, mob kills, fishing)  

**Survival / RPG mode features:**
- Yrden and Vampirism runes — add new combat skills  
- PVP mode for server lobby  
- GUI for ProtectionStones plugin  
- Property review system
- Player recommendation system connected to MySQL database

**Custom Library**
- Built a custom [**Bukkit library**](https://github.com/C00kier/CookiersLib) to simplify plugin development and enable code reuse across multiple plugins
  
### 🚗 Autoplewa.pl (TypeScript, Vue.js, Slim PHP)
AutoPlewa is a responsive car rental website developed within 3 weeks.

The client required a lightweight platform to easily publish available vehicles for rent, along with company details and a contact form.
The site was fully optimized for mobile devices to ensure a smooth experience across different screen sizes.

A custom-built admin panel enables:
- creating, editing, and deleting vehicle categories
- managing vehicle listings (add, edit, remove)
- toggling vehicle visibility on the public fleet page
