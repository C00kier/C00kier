### 🗻 Minecraft plugins for server BLACKMC.PL
Over the past few months, I have developed multiple plugins for a guild mode.

Some of the features:
- Guild upgrades
- Guild guardians - custom mobs that guild members can give basic commands and are protecting players base
- Universal reward box system - allows to add multiple different boxes that will drop from activities like breaking blocks, killing certain type of mobs or fishing. Each box and it's drop is fully customizable via configuration file.
- Set of items with unique behaviour

I have also created several plugins for survival + rpg mode:
- Yrden, Vampirism rune (which are adding new combat skills)
- PVP mode for our lobby
- GUI for ProtectionStones plugin
- Property review system
- Player recommendation system connected with mySQL database
